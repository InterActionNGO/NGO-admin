Episcopal Relief & Development,N/A,ERD-AF-08-001,Education for the Girl Child,"The Chesetoon Primary School was inaugurated in 2006 to provide an education for the girl child, as females were deprived of education during the Taliban years.   A4T school programs serve the need of young Afghan girls living in these areas by providing them an academic education and offering after-school vocational skills. The A4T students are taught two grade levels in one academic year, in an intensive curriculum approved by the government, so that female students would be catch-up on their missed education.  The school follows the national curriculum, but with a much smaller class size.  The student-teacher ratio at the school is 20:1 while in the government schools, the ratio is generally 80:1.  Originally, the Chelsetoon school provided schooling from grades 1-6, and with Episcopal Relief & Development support has been able to increase grade levels to where in 2010, the the school will operate up to grade 9.  Following new Ministry of Education regulations, A4T has obtained Ministry certification to continue classes up to grade 12.  During the first two years, the Chelsetoon Primary School was able to educate a total of 210 girls.  In 2010, the school has moved to a larger property and expects to educate 250 girl students, and provide teacher training to their committed group of teachers.",,,04/01/2008,03/31/2011,,,Food Security,Education,Capacity building,Afghans4Tomorrow,,Private donations,,250,,"Individuals, Youth",Afghanistan,Kabul,,,,,,,Nagulan Nesiah,Program Officer,nnesiah@er-d.org,www.er-d.org,10/13/2010,,

Episcopal Relief & Development,N/A,ERD-MM-09-002,Men's Association Demonstration Farm,"As Myanmar is an agricultural country where most residents depend on agriculture production as a livelihood, the Men's Association identified the need to introduce appropriate, cost effective  methods to increase productivity in the agricultural sector.  If agricultural production and income is increased, the communities will benefit from the greater economic gains, thus leading to social, economic and spiritual progress.  Introduced by a Japanese agronomist in the 1990s, Effective Microorganism (EM) technology is an environmentally friendly low-cost method of farming that allows for the production of crops without damage to the ecosystem, including effects on soil, water supplies, biodiversity or other surrounding natural resources.  The technology uses low cost and locally appropriate inputs to produce a microorganism based process for the producing organic fertilizers.  With findings of an agricultural survey, the Men's Association identified the need to provide the EM technology and innovative agricultural techniques to farmers who struggle to sustain their own farms due to increasing costs and unpredictable weather patterns.  The Association established a 6-acre demonstration farm in 2008 on donated land from one of the Association's members.  The demonstration farm uses soil from under the bamboo trees to produce EM by mixing it with molasses and rice husk.  In 2009, training subjects on biogas, using an onsite piggery, were added.  In 2010, new courses on fish ponds and economic stove will be added.  At each training, farmers will learn the improved techniques and apply them in the demonstration farm over a three-week training period in order to prepare them to use these technologies in their home farms.  In 2010, the Men's Association plans to train 80 farmers in 3 different residential training sessions.

Both extensive government regulations and high inflation rates have created economic stagnation, keeping the vast majority of the population at the poverty level.  The Mother's Union works within the church structure to assist families of ethnic minorities, who are further disadvantaged by government majoritarian policies.  As women play a crucial role in both the economic and social structures of a family, the Mother's Union programs have focused on enhancing the resources available to women to pursue greater economic stability in their families.  The Mothers Union initiated a micro-credit programme to assist women to support their family income through various entrepreneurial ventures, including mini shops, agriculture, animal husbandry and other cottage industries.  The Mother's Union began its pilot micro-credit programme in Yangon Diocese 2001.  With learnings from this pilot project, the micro-credit operations expanded and there are currently 15 self-help groups with 128 members in the Diocese of Yangon and Toungoo.

Episcopal Relief & Development,N/A,ERD-BI-08-001,Province of the Anglican Church of Burundi Integrated Development Program ,"Burundi is one of the ten poorest countries in the world characterized by a low gross domestic product, largely due to civil war, corruption, poor access to education, and the effects of HIV/AIDS. The Burundi civil war was an armed conflict lasting from 1993 to 2005 which was the result of long standing ethnic divisions between the Hutu and the Tutsi tribes in Burundi.  The integrated development program is targeting poor rural dwellers located in all 6 dioceses of the Anglican church; the Dioceses of Matana, Makamba, Bujumbura, Gitega, Buye and Muyinga. The goal of this program is aimed at strengthening livelihoods and rehabilitating 6000 of the poorest households by creating economic opportunities through microfinance loans, specifically, but not exclusively,  to those suffering from  HIV and AIDS. The Province is also working to strengthen the food supply and increase animal production in all of the dioceses which includes establishing a networking group in order to diversify the sources of income for farmers. This is of particular importance in the north of the country, where agricultural and nutrition training must take into account the potential for disaster due to drought.  In the water and sanitation program the Province is working to provide clean water to poor communities by setting up rainwater harvest projects in schools, parishes and in rural communities.  Community programs are also addressing the needs of the returning refugees, which include peace building, nonviolent conflict reconciliation, and trauma counseling. Alongside the development programming, Episcopal Relief & Development is working to strengthen and reinforce the technical capacity of the Provincial and Diocesan development staff.

Episcopal Relief & Development,N/A,ERD-CN-09-001,Qinghai Renewable Energy Integrated Program,"The 2009-2011 program is in Qinghai Province, in the far western part of China, serving Tibetan herding communities. The communities are in the source area for three of China's major rivers in a national nature preserve. The herders reside at high altitudes in the mountains, enduring the harsh climate with little access to basic services. The Tibetans raise yak herds for meat and butter. Women collect yak dung to heat their homes. Inside small, dark homes, yak butter is used as candle wax to dimly light the rooms at night, which is difficult on eyesight and on children who study. Residential schools do not have light in the evening for children to study by or hot water systems to maintain basic hygiene. There is little access to basic health knowledge and nutrition is poor, as the climate makes raising vegetables difficult. The program will provide solar power systems for herding families to provide clean energy to people in previously inaccessible areas.  This will allow for more productive activities, including study and livelihood activities, at night.  Local clinics will also be provided with light systems, enabling nighttime and emergency treatment for community members. Light and hot water systems will be provided to three residential schools so children can stay in their warm classroom in the evenings to learn and play. Provision of hot water will promote hygiene and child health. Ten household biogas systems will also be provided in conjunction with greenhouses to promote the growth of vegetables to improve community nutrition. The project also includes training in maternal and child health and hygiene, livelihood skills,and solar power maintenance.

Episcopal Relief & Development,N/A,ERD-CO-09-001,Diocesan Coordination for Development Projects,"Colombia has approximately 3 million internally displaced people, the second largest internal refugee problem in the world after Darfur, caused by violence from the civil war.  Some sources have indicated that in the Choco region, for example, there is one doctor per 10,000 people, but one soldier per 180 people.  Also, the unemployment rate is 85% and the average person makes only US$250 per year; or less than US$1 per day. Colombian society is one of the most unequal in terms of economic wealth in the world.  As a result, there is wide social and economic exclusion and huge rich to poor disparities. In the city of Cali, chronic poverty caused by social and economic exclusion and violence, has caused child malnutrition, high incidences of HIV-AIDS, family disintegration, intra-familial violence, and lack of income earning opportunities especially for women. In Quibdo, the capital of Choco, unemployed youth and street children are affected by crushing poverty, violence, and lack of economic opportunities. Great social inequality and marginalized populations of youth are easy victims of violence, prostitution, and being forced into serving with illegal armed groups. As a result and building on the church's current capacity, Episcopal Relief & Development has implemented a pilot project in partnership with the the Diocese in Colombia, to implement a microcredit project in Cali targeting women, and a youth education and training project in Quibdo, Choco.

Many Haitians sought to travel on to the capital, Santo Domingo, to search for jobs and seek assistance in acquiring new documents that were lost in the rubble.  However, there are numerous Dominican police and military check points on the road between the border and the capital.  Since many of the displaced Haitians no longer have passports or identification, they cannot pass the checkpoints.  Therefore, six months after the earthquake, it is estimated that up to 5,000 Haitians reside in limbo on the Dominican side of the international border in the town of Jimani.  After conducting a needs assessment and community diagnostic, a project was developed to respond to the needs of the Haitian refugees.  The project is an integrated recovery program that addresses both the short-term and long-term needs of 1,500 displaced Haitians in the Jimani area concurrently in an integrated fashion of food security and health programming with education, training and microeconomic development as cross-cutting themes.",,,06/01/2010,12/01/2010,,,"Recovery, Food Security, Primary Health","Health, Education, Economic Recovery and Development","Capacity building, Food security",Iglesia Episcopal Dominicana,,Private donations,,300,,Refugees,Dominican Republic,Independencia,,,,,,,Matt St. John,Program Officer,mstjohn@er-d.org,www.er-d.org,10/13/2010,,

Clergy are trained in counseling and de-escalation of conflict, while community members are taught how to handle confrontation and disagreement using nonviolent means. Post traumatic care is integrated into all aspects of community engagement, as healing and reconciliation becomes an essential ingredient for community life after years of war and violence. In an effort to rehabilitate the communities the diocese is implementing programs that focus on the basic needs of the communities. This includes HIV and AIDS support and education groups and agricultural training programs. Due to widespread HIV and AIDS as a result of the war, as well as rampant hunger the diocese works in an integrated manner in order to address as many issues as possible in each community. The church's Mothers Union, an umbrella woman's group, has formed local solidarity units for mutual support, training and development. Education in human and economic rights is essential to ending the cycle of ignorance and discrimination that limit women's lives. The program's empowerment goals also focus specifically on women who have been traumatized by rape and other sexual violence.  Rape victims are provided with access to medical care. Advocacy at local levels also works to break the stigma suffered by victims of rape, including public testimony of victims and challenges to the legal system for accountability and justice. Finally, within the solidarity groups, women receive livelihood training and some financial support for small business development through micro credit.

Most Ghanaians are small landowners relying on subsistence farming to survive, with one-third living below the poverty line. Female genital mutilation and bridal dowries are still very common in the north of Ghana. ADDRO works in an integrated approach to tackle issues of poverty and hunger, prevent malaria through the NetsforLife program, combat gender and disability discrimination, and increase access to clean water and sanitation.  (1) ADDRO works to increase household income in order for beneficiaries to gain access to health services and other basic necessities. The income generation programs work to build the skills of women in sewing and tailoring, batik (traditional cloth) making, and farming. A community run Mango plantation continues to support income generation. Beneficiaries will also be trained in the utilization of these crops in their diets to improve household nutrition. (2) The community disability rehabilitation program assists disabled community members who are blind, mentally or physically handicapped.  The program works within each community to improve their livelihoods through skills training in various trades, such as weaving and farming.

At graduation, they will have the ability to continue their education and use what they have learned to acquire employment specifically in the agriculture field, returning to their communities to share the knowledge and skills they have learned that can increase productivity through improved agricultural practices learned at the school.  After middle school, the children can choose to go to El Hogar to complete three more years of general education as well as training in agriculture and animal husbandry. At the Agricultural school they learn the principles and practicalities of animal husbandry, and crop production, nuances of drip irrigation to conserve precious water, use of animal waste as manure, and composting techniques for a more productive farm in an area which earlier used slash-and-burn methods. The students share their newfound agricultural knowledge with family and rural neighbors, thereby enhancing individual farms and the community-at-large  In addition, during their time at school, these young men are helping to implement projects in five very isolated rural communities, so that the people in those communities can develop new kinds of crops and know how to market them effectively.",,,01/01/2006,12/31/2010,,,Food Security,Agriculture,Capacity building,El Hogar,,Private donations,,100,,"Individuals, Youth",Honduras,"Francisco Morazán, El Paraíso, Copán",,,,,,,Karla Avila,Program Officer,kavila@er-d.org,www.er-d.org,10/13/2010,,

A recent smaller study in Malaita showed a lower literacy rate, and the figure for literacy in Vanuatu is estimated at 74%.  In this programme, the Mothers Union intends to strengthen its literacy courses in all eight Dioceses by enhancing teaching methods and developing new resources and materials for both the Diocesan coordinators and teachers. A train-the-trainer component for a core group of teachers will invest in better methods for teaching the languages. New materials will include important community topics like preventive health education, small enterprise management, and life skills.  Melanesia is economically very challenged and most income comes from overseas remittances.  Helping women to have the basic skills to maintain inventories and manage community activities will contribute to the economic stability and health of the communities.

Episcopal Relief & Development,N/A,ERD-LK-08-001,Post-Disaster Livelihood Micro-Credit Programme,"ECLOF Lanka began its tsunami response two years after the tsunami as those affected were better able to restart livelihoods. Since the people affected directly or indirectly living in the tsunami areas have no access to finance from formal financial sources due to the lack of collateral, the ECLOF Lanka programme is one of the only avenues for beneficiaries to start up new activities that would generate income for sustainability. ECLOF Lanka identifies clients in the tsunami affected areas by weighing heavily on the support and information from respective local government offices. At these local government officers are personnel identified for development of income-generating livelihood programmes. These persons assist in the formation of groups / societies of women's along with the grass root level officer called  Grama Sevaka Niladhari (Village Level Officer). These government agents conduct awareness programmes in the training of various income generate projects with the assistance of social organizations and other volunteer technical consultants. As the traditional wage earner in the family is the male, ECLOF Lanka's efforts will have a direct impact on women as over 95% of loan recipients are women.

Episcopal Relief & Development,N/A,ERD-SD-06-001,SUDRA Development Program,"The Sudanese Relief and Development Agency carries out agriculture projects in order to address the widespread hunger and extreme poverty. Many people have lost their agricultural knowledge, or never learned how to farm during the more than 20 years of war, one of the longest running conflicts on the continent until the ceasefire in 2005. The plight of returning refugees, of which there are more than four million in Southern Sudan, is particularly difficult.  They must rely on food aid, which often does not last to the first harvest. Recent attacks on food convoys add to their plight as well as increasing tribal violence and spillover attacks from neighboring conflicts.  The current program provides workshops on agriculture training and provide tools and farming inputs. A pilot agricultural program will take place in select dioceses across the south. Most dioceses have small gardens which can be improved through training and through the purchase of more seeds and tools. These programs aim to be simple, of a moderate scale, and relatively inexpensive in order to persist during instability and conflict.  Episcopal Relief & Development also supports the establishment of agricultural office through the hiring and training of staff. The agriculture office assists the individual dioceses with training, planning, development, and technical assistance in implementation of projects.

Episcopal Relief & Development,N/A,ERD-PH-10-001,2010 Buscalan Integrated Development Project,"Agricultural production is low due to limited farmlands. During dry season, these farms require irrigation water and the community presently relies on an irrigation canal with a length of 750 meters carved out by the community along mountainsides. As it is not paved, bank leakages and floor seepages are high and the volume of water that finally reaches the farmlands are significantly lower than what is accessed from the river source. Because of such leakages and seepages, the canal is also prone to erosion and thus it is often un-usable due to the wash-out of certain sections. With the unreliability of this irrigation canal, the cultivation of farmlands during the dry season is not maximized. The project seeks to improve this canal so that it becomes a reliable source of irrigation and thus enable the community to maximize cultivation even during the dry season. It shall widen, deepen and concretize the canal to make a 0.03 m x 0.50 m sturdy channel section to eliminate bank leakages and seepages/percolations. Such improved irrigation system will also increase the speed of water flow, increase the volume of water conveyed to the rice fields and greatly reduce maintenance works.",,,01/01/2010,12/31/2010,,,"Food Security, Primary Health",Agriculture,,The Episcopal Church in the Philippines,,Private donations,,668,,Individuals,Philippines,Pampanga,,,Central Luzon,,,,Matt St. John,Program Officer,mstjohn@er-d.org,www.er-d.org,10/13/2010,,
Episcopal Relief & Development,N/A,ERD-PH-10-002,2010 Sitio San Miguel Community Integrated Project,"This is an integrated project intended to enhance food security as well as environmental advocacy. The components of the project are: a]  provision of farm machineries to increase income of beneficiaries by lessening rental costs; b]  establishment of nursery and reforestation of about 30 hectares of land; c]  construction of spring water system; d]  goat and pig dispersal for women's group; and, d] micro-finance to support livelihood opportunities. While sitio San Miguel is part of Digos City, it is actually a rural community of mostly hired farm workers who do not own any farm lands. There are however about 25 households who are small land-owners and who shall constitute the initial direct beneficiaries of this project.  Many of these households own  less than a hectare of land with a few having over one hectare. With these landholdings, they  can barely support themselves economically due to high cost of farm inputs and rental of farm machineries. By making available farm machineries: mud turtle, rice thresher, a hand tractor and trailer,  at lower rental costs, and by establishing a small credit facility which they can use for the purchase of inputs, the income of these farmers will substantially increase and will enable them to have a more substantial control over the agricultural production and marketing processes. The nursery is intended to propagate coffee and other agro-forest tree seedlings for reforestation of a public land, measuring about 30 hectares, much of which is presently bare, with gmelina trees scatted in some parts. By reforesting this area, the community enhances biological diversity while at the same time providing future source of additional income from coffee, rubber and other agro-forest trees. The community is presently negotiating with the Department of Agriculture for stewardship rights over this public land. [Propagation of rubber tree seedlings shall be done at the existing rubber tree plantation of St. Francis High School in North Upi, Maguindanao, which is a previous Diocesan Project.]While women are envisioned to actively participate in all the components of the project, a specific activity, which is the goat and pig dispersal, shall be managed by them in order to enhance their collective capacity to promote their sectoral interests and to empower them by making them directly responsible for raising additional household income. Finally, a potable water system shall be established to augment the present limited supply of water to the community.

Episcopal Relief & Development,N/A,ERD-PH-10-003,2010 San Vicente Drainage & Livelihood Project,"This is a climate change adaptation and livelihood project.  More specifically, it seeks to construct a 1 square meter x 300 meters box reinforced concrete covered canal on one side of the street leading to a creek and thus complete a drainage system that will address the problem of perennial flooding in the community. It shall also establish a Livelihood Fund of P200,000, which the beneficiaries can access to enhance their various livelihood ventures. San Vicente is a barangay of Cabiao municipality in the province of Nueva Ecija, one of the provinces is what is referred to as the Central Plains. Cabiao is about 100 kms. northeast of Manila. San Vicente is its last barangay adjacent to the province of Pampanga. Hence, it is near to the Pampanga River Basin. During rainy seasons, the barangays of Cabiao nearest to Pampanga, including San Vicente, is always flooded with overflow water from the Pampanga River. The flooding has become worse in recent years when the level of precipitation has greatly increased. With no drainage system that can divert flood waters to an exit point, the flooded communities can remain submerged in water for several weeks. This has adversely affected ricefields, houses and household belongings as well as brought about diseases. The barangay is home to small-scale farmers, with average monthly household income of only P3,650. Because of the destructive flooding problem, San Vicente's inhabitants have long been clamoring for a drainage system. The barangay has started this project but after several years of lobbying with the municipal and provincial governments, it has accessed funds sufficient to construct only 100 meters of the drainage system. While this has benefitted a portion of the community, the bigger portions continue to suffer the problem. Hence, they have approached several funding partners for possible assistance. This proposed project will complete the drainage system by constructing a 300-meter extension. The project will then set up a credit facility to assist the beneficiaries in commencing or enhancing livelihood activities. The beneficiaries are presently organized under the San Vicente Farmers Association, which shall manage the proposed credit facility.",,,01/01/2010,12/31/2010,,,"Food Security, Primary Health","Agriculture, Disaster Management","Climate change, Disaster risk reduction (DRR)",The Episcopal Church in the Philippines,,Private donations,,"6,500",,Individuals,Philippines,Pampanga,,,Central Luzon,,,,Matt St. John,Program Officer,mstjohn@er-d.org,www.er-d.org,10/13/2010,,

It is conceived to enable the farmers-beneficiaries to compete with the current local marketing institutions utilizing the merchandising tools available only to large institutions such as: economies of scale and value added. The project shall provide seed capital for setting up this infrastructure and shall be implemented by the Federation of Cooperatives in the Diocese of Northern Luzon [FEDCO-EDNL]. While the project is primarily intended to empower farmers-beneficiaries through their respective cooperatives to gain better control of market forces, it shall also take this opportunity to significantly campaign for environmentally sound farming practices, initially the promotion of the use of rice husk for household fuel to address the problem of rice husk accumulation and burning. With the provision of the start up capital, the project is hoped to attain a projected possible procurement share of 3,700 MT of palay or 1,850 MT per cropping at two months (60) days peak period. The project needs to dispatch 30 MT of palay or one 10 wheeler load daily during the peak period of 60 days at its main warehouse.

International Relief & Development,9041,IRD-KH-08-09041,Food for Peace (FFP): Improving Nutrition in Cambodia III,"Direct food distribution and nutrition/health education. The program's overall goal is to improve the health and nutritional status of vulnerable groups in Battambang, particularly children under 5 years of age, orphans and vulnerable children, and landmine victims and their families. This goal was chosen with reference to the latest anthropometric survey data for Cambodia indicating the decreased nutritional security of poor children under five and other vulnerable groups, especially among urban poor. The program is expected to reach approximately 7,500 direct beneficiaries.  Specific objectives are to:
1. Improve the quantity and quality of food intake among children under 5 years of age, orphans and vulnerable children, landmine victims and their families.
2. Improve complementary feeding practices of mothers with children under 5 years of age through nutrition education.
3. Increase knowledge and awareness of appropriate health behaviors among mothers or caretakers of children under 5 years of age and orphans and vulnerable children.
4. Increase knowledge and awareness about dangers of landmines through Mine Risk Education sessions for parents and caretakers of orphans and vulnerable children and landmine victims.
5. Build the capacity of local NGOs to implement supplementary feeding programs that effectively integrate health & nutrition education and mine risk education.
","Distribute 75 metric tons (MT) of Breedlove commodities to children under 5 years of age, orphans and vulnerable children (OVC), and landmine victims and provide health and nutrition education in Battambang province. The intervention is designed to both build on the lessons learned of IRD's past International Food Relief Partnership (IFRP) projects in Cambodia, and also respond to the latest nutritional and food security data in the region. Through the proposed distributions and accompanying health and nutrition education, this project will help alleviate the current food security crisis by improving the nutritional intake of children under 5 years of age, orphans and vulnerable children, and landmine victims and their families.  By working with local NGO partners, the project will also enhance the capacity of local partners to respond to health and nutrition needs in the province, thereby strengthening cooperation between local NGOs and communities.

This project has included three basic and overlapping components: (1) distribution of textured soy protein (TSP) for improved nutrition by vulnerable households; (2) training and investment activities to improve the production and hygiene of small-scale soy businesses; and (3) animal husbandry activities targeted for people living with HIV/AIDS.","IRD distributed 7.66 metric tons (MT) of textured soy protein (TSP) over a 4-month period from June through September 2009. IRD targeted poor and vulnerable households with TSP by utilizing existing home-based care programs operated by local NGOs as distribution channels. In total, IRD reached 4637 individuals through the distribution of TSP. This included 1,045 households (2272 family members) of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) and 619 households (2236 family members) with orphans and vulnerable children (OVC).  IRD provided six separate soy processing and general hygiene trainings related to small-scale manufacturers (and potential manufacturers) of soy products. These trainings each lasted 1-2 days and covered a number of topics, including: (1) the value of soybeans; (2) hygiene and sanitation for food handlers; (3) hard tofu production; (4) soft tofu production; (5) fermented soybean production; (6) traditional soy sauce production; (7) soy ice cream production; and (8) improved soymilk production.  IRD provided nine businesses with targeted investments aimed at: (1) improving the hygiene and sanitation of these small-scale production operations and (2) improving the production process so as to facilitate expansion, increased profitability, and efficiency of the manufacturing operations. These investments included upgrades to the structural facilities of the production areas, such as providing roofs, and concrete walls and floors. It also included capital investments in items such as stainless steel tofu molds, cooking pots, grinders, and small generators. IRD's strategy for promoting animal husbandry has involved both training and start-up support to vulnerable households. In July 2009, IRD provided three-day animal husbandry trainings to 10 PLWHA families. Furthermore, IRD provided 9 of these individuals with five hens to begin poultry operations, as well as access to okara from partner soy businesses. As of December 2009, most of the households had expanded their operations, with many of the beneficiaries more than doubling their quantity of chickens. Only two households were identified as having fewer chickens, one of which seemed to be hit with a blight. IRD was unable to meet with two families because they had moved in search of seasonal labor. The beneficiaries of poultry raising were located in Kampong Cham and 2 districts, Kampong Siem and Kampong Cham districts.","Interventions ended August 31, 2009",09/01/2008,08/31/2010,,,Sustainable Food and Agriculture Systems (FSAS),"Agriculture, Health, Economic Recovery and Development",Nutrition,International Relief & Development,,National Soybean Research Laboratory (NSRL),Prime awardee,"2,714",,"People living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), Orphans and vulnerable children (OVC), Soy-business owners",Cambodia,Kampong Cham,"Kampong Seam, Kampong Cham, Tbong Kmum, Memot, Cheung Prey, Bateay, Chamkar Leu, Oreang Ov, Steung Trong","Ampil, Soung, Memot, Skoun, Sandeach, Cheung Chnok, Sambor, Veal Vong, Sambour Meas, Krolas, Thnal Beak, Speu, Prek Ko, Mesa Chhey, Kong Chey",,,550300,1325900,Tanja Pavlovic,Program Officer,tpavlovic@ird-dc.org,http://www.ird.org,09/07/2010,,

The consequences are a decrease of agricultural production, mainly in the yield of cereals and cash crops such as cotton. The Malian National Action Plan of Adaptation to CC highlights the high vulnerability of rural small farmers, who are the main beneficiaries of the program. Therefore it is necessary to evaluate and implement possible adaptation options for program beneficiaries, particularly women. Linked to this wider program, the processes of action-research are intended to support small scale rural farmers to reduce their vulnerability and to better adapt to the climate variability including extreme events and climate change. Beyond the need to understand the precise nature of this vulnerability and to make an assessment of the possible adaptation options, another challenge is ensuring that a larger number of farmers master these strategies and adaptation options and implement them in communities. Assessment will lead to better information, education and communication campaign on climate change and its adverse effects. Pilot projects will also be implemented to test the best sustainable practices for adaptation, such as the early warning systems, innovative risk-reducing community funds, and the use of the available research results.

PATH,6,PATH-IN-08-002,Pilot Demonstration of Ultra Rice in Naandi Mid-Day Meal (MDM) Programme,"PATH is building demand for Ultra Rice in existing public-sector funded meal programs as a market entry strategy.  This approach has allowed PATH to test the feasibility, acceptance and effectiveness of Ultra Rice kernels, establish distribution to nutritionally vulnerable groups with little incremental cost, and cultivate demand from institutional buyers to drive economies of scale. It has also allowed Ultra Rice to be produced at an even more affordable price for later entry into commercial markets that serve the poor. In partnership with the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN), PATH launched a two-phase demonstration project to test the operational feasibility of incorporating Ultra Rice into the Naandi Foundation's centralized kitchen in Vishakhapatnam, India. There, rice fortified with Ultra Rice was blended with traditional rice at point-of-use (""wet"" blending) and was served daily to 60,000 children under the government-sponsored Mid-day Meal Scheme, which provides lunches each day to 120 million resource-poor schoolchildren throughout India. This first phase took place from 1 December 2008 to 31 March 2010. In Phase B of the pilot demonstration with GAIN and the Naandi Foundation, PATH explored alternative blending scenarios (this time: dry-blending) with Daneshekar Rice Mill, a small rice miller in Tamil Nadu. Phase B of the pilot demonstration, which lasted from 1 January 2009 to 15 May 2010, proved the operational feasibility of the dry blending method, particularly with a small rice miller.",,"The Government of India's Department of Biotechnology (DBT), within the Ministry of Science and Technology, continues to generously support promising research into the efficacy and effectiveness of Ultra Rice in multiple locations and demographic groups (in India).

A focus on poverty, gender, and environmental and social responsibility of business (ESRB) will be mainstreamed across all Winrock prawn interventions.
","The specific activities of the expanded prawn program are:
- Design and implement market development interventions for the prawn market building on the learning and experiences of Katalyst.
- Incorporate pro-poor strategies in designing interventions so that the impacts can benefit the people living below the poverty line and whose livelihood depends directly or indirectly on prawn market.
- Incorporate gender strategies in designing interventions so that women can be more empowered by being economic agents in different stages of the prawn value chain.
- Tackle environmental concerns, wherever applicable, so that the interventions address the issues related to environmental degradation.
- Create public-private partnership in promoting sustainable development to ensure that the impacts are distributed across that value chain leading to equitable development and improved livelihood for the poor.
