Financed by PEPFAR, AIDSRelief is a consortium effort led by CRS in partnership with the University of Maryland Institute of Human Virology (IHV), Futures Group, and the Catholic Medical Mission Board.  AIDSRelief works to improve access to HIV care and treatment, and reduce new HIV infections.  Through AIDSReliefs network of seven faith-based local partner treatment facilities (LPTFs) in Haiti, more than 7,000 PLHIV have received care and 2,373 are currently receiving anti-retroviral therapy (ART). Committed to the sustainability of treatment for PLHIV, AIDSRelief has been working to build local capacity to manage HIV care and treatment programs.  In line with PEPFARs directives, CRS  is working to transition program management to a local organization.  As the lead agency in the consortium, CRS provides overall program coordination and oversight for grant administration and compliance, as well as coordinates the representation of the grant to USG, local government and other stakeholders. CRS oversees the implementation of all project activities within an effective planning framework and manages the necessary USG financial resources for each consortium member, enabling them to carry out their work based on clear program deliverables within donor-approved funding limits. CRS also coordinates the efforts on Health System Strengthening and takes the lead for the Transition process. ","Goal: provide high quality care and treatment to people living with HIV and AIDS.

Objective 1: Existing ART service providers (tiers 5 and selected 4) rapidly scale up delivery of quality ART.

Objective 2: The number of health care facilities (tiers 4 and 3) providing quality ART is increased and capacity at sites in tiers 1 and 2 is increased to allow initiation of ART.

Objective 3: Expand community-level services providing quality ART to vulnerable and low-income HIV-infected people.

Objective 4: Create and strengthen health care treatment networks to support capacity building within countries and communities.

Crosscutting Intermediate Result: Community mobilization promotes an increased awareness of accessible and affordable programs and reduces stigma.

CRS, having vast experience in Haiti and internationally working with children and families, in collaboration with FHI (one of the worlds largest and most influential international HIV/AIDS and technical assistance organizations) and ICC (one of the leading partners of Haitis Ministry of Public Health and Population  MSPP in the fight against tuberculosis), works to create an innovative, integrated approach to HIV/AIDS in five of Haitis ten departments (Northwest, Nippes, Artibonite, South and Grande Anse). Combined, the team has significant experience delivering services in Haiti related to HIV/AIDS, TB, maternal and child health (MCH), nutrition and Livelihood. The combined technical expertise and regional knowledge of the Community Health and AIDS Mitigation Program (CHAMP) team will help guide a decentralized, department-based integrated sub-grants program that mobilizes other nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and community-based organizations (CBOs) throughout the five geographic intervention areas. CHAMP will address the following issues:  Poor integration of
healthcare services provided to people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHA), orphans and vulnerable children (OVC) and families, including MCH, nutrition, and social assistance services;  Weak participation of community members in decisions that affect their lives, including health care issues;  Lack of resources, leadership and governance at the community level;  Ineffective referral systems between service delivery points at the community level; and,  Lack of coordination between private and public health sectors and among the private health sector to avoid duplication of effort and resources. The
vision of CHAMP is guided by the principles of empowerment, decentralization, and integration to create communities where families participate actively in the health care decisions that affect their lives; where a comprehensive range of services are available at the community level; and where government, NGOs, CBOs, and community members work together in dynamic and collaborative partnership to achieve common goals. Perhaps most importantly it diminishes the stigmatization so often associated with vertical HIV/AIDS programs, by drawing in a large following of non-HIV clients for other
services. HIV+ clients are therefore willing and able to receive the services they need without the suspicion or shame of going to an HIV clinic or receiving a home visit from an HIV outreach worker.","The overarching goal of CHAMP for CRS is to improve the health and quality of life of vulnerable families and PLHA in five of Haitis ten geographical departments. SO1: Increase the organizational, technical and leadership capacity of the health sector to effectively serve PLHA and vulnerable families; SO2: Expand availability, accessibility and use of integrated care and support services among PLHA and vulnerable families in five geographic departments of Haiti.",,7/1/2009,2/28/2014,"$17,586,316 ",Protection,"Health, Protection",,"Family Health International (FHI), Catholic Relief Services (CRS), International Child Care",,"US Agency for International Development (USAID), Private donations","9,814","People living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), Children",Haiti,"Grand'Anse, Nord-Ouest, Artibonite, Sud, Nippes","Anse d'Hainault, Mole Saint Nicholas, Gonaïves, Jérémie, Gros-Morne, Saint-Marc, Corail, Port-de-Paix, Les Cayes, Port-Salut, Miragoâne","Dame-Marie, Jean-Rabel, Gonaïves, Jérémie, Gros-Morne, Saint-Marc, Pestel, Port-de-Paix, Bombardopolis, Les Cayes, Port-Salut, Fonds-des-Negres, Miragoâne",Nicole Balliette,Haiti Earthquake Response Coordinator,,,9/24/2010
Catholic Relief Services (CRS),CRS-HT-10-7420207,Haiti Earthquake Emergency Response/ Health,"CRS primary health care project addressed the increased needs of Port-au-Princes population for basic health care in the immediate post-earthquake period.  This four month project had three components: primary care for displaced people, public health messaging to prevent communicable disease, and hospital care for more serious needs.  From late January through mid-may, the projects teams of doctors and nurses worked in 10 camps for internally displaced people, providing vaccinations, treating minor injuries and ailments, and counseling families on preventing communicable disease.  The project also supported key public health messaging to raise awareness about the importance of vaccination and hand washing to prevent potential outbreaks of communicable disease in the camps close quarters.  Finally, the project supported hospital care at Notre Dame de Lourdes hospital in Port-au-Prince, helping this Catholic hospital provide free care to those with more severe injuries or ailments.  Following the immediate response period, CRS transitioned to the Health Systems Strengthening (HSS) program which aims to strengthen the Catholic Health system in Haiti.  The HSS program will solidify CRS support for the Catholic Health system, complementing other ongoing CRS health work and enabling a comprehensive, long-term response.  The program is expected to work with at least eight hospitals: St François de Sales, St Damien, Sacré Cur de Milot, St Boniface, St Jean de Limbé, Alma Mater, Espérance and Clinique Bethel.

Catholic Relief Services (CRS),CRS-HT-10-7420114,Multi-Year Assistance Program,"The MYAP builds on the success of previous CRS Haiti DAPs by tightening the geographic targeting to highly food insecure, environmentally fragile watersheds.  Rather than dispersing sector activities across wide geographic areas, this MYAP will take a holistic and focused approach to manage risks and reduce vulnerability to food insecurity.

Agriculture and natural resource management in these watersheds will include a FFW component.  In addition to the recuperative feeding program, the MCHN feeding program will now provide supplemental family rations for all children 6-24 months.  These rations will be delivered directly to the Rally Posts.  This change increases coverage to all at risk children before their growth falters.  It also saves the mother's time and effort by bringing food closer to the target villages.  

The Haiti MYAP education component builds on CRS' experience in food-assisted education activities in the proposed MYAP-targeted watershed.  The past DAP education component was successfully evaluated and demonstrated a high level of achievement against both impact and monitoring indicators.  The strengths and lessons learned inform this MYAP.

In the context of the FFP Strategic Framework, the MYAP will reach 144,060 direct and 143,800 indirect beneficiaries in the South, South East, Nippes, and Grande Anse Departments.  Natural Resource Management (NRM) activities will protect and enhance farmers' livelihoods.  Improved farming and conservation technique will influence key factors affecting food security.  Improved access to and quality of education and health services will protect and enhance the human capabilities of primary school students, pregnant and lactating women, and vulnerable infants and children. Early warning and emergency surge capacity will improve community resiliency in accordance with Development Relief (DR) principles.  Unconditional safety nets will protect extremely vulnerable populations including people affected by HIV and AIDS.","Goal: The most vulnerable communities in Haiti, particularly those in the South Department, have reduced their food insecurity by 2012.

law and accompanied by gross human rights violations.

Episcopal Relief & Development,ERD-HT-10-002,Economic Independence & Community Recovery,"In line with national efforts, Episcopal Relief & Developments national partner, CEDDISEC, has launched a Cash for Work program that not only creates employment and increases household economic independence, but also provides opportunities for the leadership and participation of Haitians in community-based recovery efforts. Giving people a voice and a sense of control in their own recovery and future is an important first step on the road to reducing stress and facilitating sustainable development.  Creating both cash and pride at the community level, the program methodology encourages community-based committees to identify and lead their communitys recovery projects; thus giving people the opportunity to make decisions as well as identify program participants. Program objectives are:  1) To provide immediate support toward economic independence to at least 1,820 individuals (directly), and thus an estimated 9,100 individuals/family members (indirectly), with an intentional effort to include women; 2) To restore a sense of structure, and to reduce stress and violence through the creation of 40+ Cash for Work projects that provide at least US$100 in wages/worker through 20-days of short-term work in community-identified, parish-led projects; and 3) To support the engagement of Haitians and Episcopal Parishes of the Episcopal Diocese of Haiti in community-based recovery. Some of the types of community recovery projects being identified and supported are: rubble removal; rehabilitation of local markets, clinics, schools and churches; sanitation campaigns; hurricane preparedness through rebuilding of roads and ditches; and special assistance for vulnerable community members.",,,5/1/2010,12/31/2010,,Early Recovery,Economic Recovery and Development,Gender,"Episcopal Diocese of Haiti, Centre Diocésain de Secours (CEDISEC), Parish of Annunciation","Parish of St. Paul, Parish of Ascension de Thor, Parish of St. Matthias, Parish of St. Simeon, Parish of St. Matthieu, Parish of St. Marc, Parish of St. Etienne, Parish of Epiphanie, Bishop Tharp Institute (BTI), lUniversité Episcopal DHaïti (UNEPH), Centre Diocésain de Secours (CEDISEC)",Private donations,"1,567","Internally displaced persons (IDPs), Vulnerable households, University students",Haiti,"Sud, Ouest, Sud-Est","Les Cayes, Léogâne, Croix-des-Bouquets, Port-au-Prince, Jacmel","Torbeck, Grand-Goâve, Croix-des-Bouquets, Léogâne, Gressier, Carrefour, Jacmel, Port-au-Prince, Les Cayes",Tammi Mott,Haiti Recovery Program,tmott@er-d.org,,9/13/2010

Early in the response phase, Episcopal Relief & Development supported its partner, the Episcopal Diocese of Haiti, to reconstruct public latrines at 4 parish/Episcopal institutions throughout the Léogâne area where people were gathering in displacement camps. On-going sanitation work includes the reconstruction of damaged household latrines as well as the construction of new household and public latrines for rural populations in Léogâne (Trouin), Grand-Goâve (Grande Colline), and Cabaret (Casale). The objectives for the current phase of the Household & Public Sanitation program are: 1) To restore a sense of privacy and security to 250+ families through the construction of household latrines and showers; 2) To improve basic hygiene and sanitation in public spaces for an estimated 5,500 individuals (est. 1,100/community) through the construction of public latrines and showers in 5 communities; and 3) To create short-term economic independence for 510 individuals through the creation of over 12,240 hours of employment (est. 2 workers for 4 days/latrine or shower).",,,2/1/2010,12/31/2010,,Water Sanitation and Hygiene,Water and Sanitation,,"Episcopal Diocese of Haiti, Centre Diocésain de Secours (CEDISEC)","Parish of St. Mattias, Parish of St. Simeon, Parish of St. Marc, Parish of St. Etienne, Parish of Epiphanie, Parish of St. Croix, Parish of Annunciation, Parish of St. Matthieu, Parish of St. Andre ",,"7,832","Internally displaced persons (IDPs), Vulnerable households",Haiti,Ouest,"Léogâne, Croix-des-Bouquets, Arcahaie","Grand-Goâve, Croix-des-Bouquets, Léogâne, Arcahaie",Tammi Mott,Haiti Recovery Program,tmott@er-d.org,,9/13/2010
Episcopal Relief & Development,ERD-HT-10-004,Provisional Homes,"In line with the philosophy that development begins with individual and community participation and choice, the overarching goal of the Provisional Home program is to create opportunities for individual and community participation in home construction; thus encouraging an individuals sense of ownership of his/her home and work, versus being a beneficiary of someone elses project. In designated locations, Episcopal priests and community committees work in collaboration with local authorities (Casecs) to identify both the families in need of immediate provisional housing, as well as construction workers (skilled and unskilled).  Program staff work alongside these individuals to build the initial houses as well as train the local construction teams on the important security, durability, and utility characteristics of the CEDDISEC provisional home.  The 18.15m2 model includes a reinforced wooden frame, raised brick foundation, concrete floors, tin roofing, plywood walls, interior and exterior painting, exterior latrine and shower, and insecticide-treated bed nets.  The objectives for the current phase of the Provisional Home program are: 1) To restore a sense of physical and emotional security to 200 homeless families through the construction of one provisional home per family; 2) To improve household privacy, health, sanitation, and hygiene through the construction of an outdoor shower and latrine, and the provision of 2 insecticide-treated mosquito nets per provisional home/family; and 3) To create short-term economic independence for 500 individuals through the creation of over 42,000 hours of employment (5-6 workers for 5-7 days/home) during the construction of 200 provisional homes.",,,7/1/2010,12/31/2010,,"Shelter and Non-Food Items, Water Sanitation and Hygiene","Shelter and Housing, Water and Sanitation",Gender,"Episcopal Diocese of Haiti, Centre Diocésain de Secours (CEDISEC)","Parish of St. Mattheiu, Parish of Annunciation, Parish of Ascension de Thor",Private donations,876,"Internally displaced persons (IDPs), Vulnerable households",Haiti,Ouest,"Léogâne, Carrefour","Léogâne, Carrefour",Tammi Mott,Haiti Recovery Program,tmott@er-d.org,,9/13/2010

The Bishop Tharp Business and Technology Institute (BTI) is an Episcopal community college located in the southwestern city of Les Cayes.  BTI addresses youths education needs by training young people in key business management skills through a two-year curriculum emphasizing business administration, language, and computer skills. Since 2006, Episcopal Relief & Development has been providing operating support for BTI.

Extreme soil erosion and deforestation, combined with the devastating impact of the January 12th earthquake, have resulted in Haiti having one of the most disadvantageous environments and economies in the world. Haiti faces a significant structural food deficit, and malnutrition is widespread. This agriculture and environmental program focuses on improving the food production of peasant populations through a diversified reforestation, gardening, and agro-forestry program.  In this way, the program addresses both the short-term food needs of the people and the long-term environmental needs to prevent soil erosion in mountainous areas.  Working with the farmers association, CODEP, in the Léogâne and Grand-Goâve communes, this programs objectives are: 1) To promote soil stabilization through the establishment of 140 miles of hedgerow terraces on mountainsides; 2) To combat deforestation through training and planting of up to 1,000,000 trees; and 3) To improve household food diversity through the establishment of household vegetable gardens.",,,7/1/2006,1/1/2011,,Food Security and Agriculture,"Agriculture, Environment","Environment, Livelihoods",Comprehensive Development Project (CODEP),Haiti Fund Inc.,Private donations,"3,000",Rural Farmers,Haiti,Ouest,Léogâne,Léogâne,Mathew St. John,Program Officer,mstjohn@er-d.org,,5/17/2010

Heifer International,HEFI-HT-10-23-1405-02,Saut Mathurine Sustainable Dairy Farm Project,"This five year project will increase food security and income for 780 families in the Saut Mathurine region by improving soil fertility
and increasing crop diversity. The project will also provide organizational strengthening for the Small Farmer Organization of Saut
Mathurine (OPS), located in the second district of Camp Perrin, which is comprised of 19 small farmer groups and focuses on
agriculture and community improvement. Three-hundred and ninety families will benefit directly from resources of the project and
390 additional families will benefit from the passing on the gift process. From the original families, two-hundred and forty will benefit
from grain, fruit, and vegetable seeds such as yams, banana creoles, and coffee plants, and one hundred and fifty families will
receive locally purchased Creole heifers, to be crossed with six Brown Swiss and Jersey bulls to increase milk and meat production.
A veterinary pharmacy will be established at Saut Mathurine in order to keep the animals healthy. Activities in this project will
include soil conservation through forage planting, living barriers in gardens, and dry walls in ravines, reforestation with forest and
fruit trees, plantation of bananas and plantains, yams, and coffee, animal husbandry, and environmental protection of the Cavaillon
river watershed. Training will include dairy cattle husbandry, selection, and improved breeding, forages, soil conservation, nursery
production, reforestation, grafting, planting bananas, yams, and coffee, and basic transformation of milk. In order to strengthen
OPS, farmers will receive training in Cornerstones planning and administration, civic education, gender equity, participatory
evaluation, and leadership. Each farmer group will train a community promoter. One new promoter in each smaller farmer group will
be trained in skills such as: animal husbandry, nursery production, and gender equity. Exchanges with dairy farmers in Honduras
and the Dominican Republic will round out the training experience. This project will be managed by a committee of seven members
that are elected by the members of OPS including some present leaders. This committee will assure the families benefit from this
project, and meet the conditions necessary to receive resources such as forages and animal shelters.",,,7/1/2006,6/30/2011,"$148,970 ",Food Security and Agriculture,Agriculture,,Peasent Organization of Saut Mathurine (OPS),,Private donations,"3,900",18 Community Associations,Haiti,Sud,Les Cayes,Camp-Perrin,"Corbin B.

SMCS will continue to provide ongoing, local technical assistance to improve storage and distribution practices at treatment and care facilities. ","Major activities include: (1) Capacity Building: Development of master trainers for the training of pharmacists, site managers and drug dispensers working in treatment centers on the techniques of logistics and stock management.  Quarterly workshops are taking place with 20-40 participants/session; (2) Warehousing: SCMS is the main buyer for lab supplies in Haiti, with responsibility for between 85-100 percent of the national need. To meet this need SCMS established a 1400 m sq warehouse in Port-au-Prince.  The warehouse uses an automated WMS tool; (3) Distribution: In 2006 distribution was to 12 sites. The network now includes more than 100 sites across the country. SCMS participated in finalizing the MOU between the Ministry of Health and Clinton Foundation to provide free 2nd-line ARVs to Haiti.  SCMS stores and distributes these medicines.","In November of 2009 CHAI and SCMS partnered together and completed a national quantification for all commodities (ARVs, other drugs, RTKs, lab reagents and supplies) for the PMTCT program in collaboration with UNICEF and CHAI.  Established hypothesis, assumptions and targets for the next two years and ensured that all needs are within the allotted UNITAID budget for Haiti. In addition SCMS and CHAI have been working to develop a laboratory quantification tool.  This tool will permit quantification based on the units of distribution of laboratory supplies and on their aggregation into testing kits for more simplified usage and better stock management.  The modified tool was to be ready for testing by the end of January 2010.  There are no updates at this time. Fondation Sogebank, a Global Fund PR, has asked for PFSCM to submit a proposal for the provision of services for the storage and distribution of HIV/AIDS commodities.  The intention is for PFSCM to work with Sogebank in establishing a national supply chain system for these commodities that will eventually transition to the responsibility of the Haitian Government.  In collaboration with partners, primary activities could include: forecasting and supply planning, procurement, warehousing (dedicated Sogebank facility) and training and commissioning of the facility and all associated staff, and distribution.  Currently PFSCM is procuring commodities through the VPP mechanism for Sogebank.  ",,,,Health,Health,,"Management Sciences for Health (MSH), GHESKIO, FOSREF, Aids Relief, POZ, Concerned Haitian Americans of Illinois (CHAI)","US Agency for International Development (USAID), Centers for Disease Control, Ministry of Health, National Lab, COAG, MSH/SDSH, GF",US Agency for International Development (USAID),,,Haiti,Ouest,Port-au-Prince,Delmas,,,,http://scms.pfscm.org/scms,

The program has the following objectives:
 To work with several Master Trainers in the field of sport and youth development to develop an expanded cadre of 50 professional Haitian caregivers and teachers with the capacity to provide healthy, attentive and developmental programs for school-aged youth through participation in the Moving Forward Training of Trainers (ToT) methodology.
 To increase the resiliency, self-worth, self-agency, social inclusion and classroom performance of 1,500 youth in affected communities through participation in structured healing, and play-based activities in the Moving Forward program.
 To build a network of skilled youth workers, coaches, and educators committed to the physical and emotional well being of youth through sports, games, and play-based activities, which will meet monthly and engage in joint activities between groups.
 To organize two commemorative events: project launch on July 11, 2010 (World Cup Final) and project completion on January 12, 2010 (one year anniversary of the earthquake) with the goal of celebrating the role of youth and sports in renewing Haiti.

Operation Blessing International,OBI-HT-10-010,Big Busters Mosquito Abatement Program,"With the Haitian governments approval, Operation Blessing will soon start a hatchery for Gambusia  tiny fish that eat mosquito larvae  that are used all around the world as a green, natural, and sustainable method of mosquito control, which is key in eradicating the root cause of diseases including malaria and dengue fever (Haiti is the only western country where malaria remains epidemic). Currently, the State of Virginias Mosquito Control office is raising 4,000 breeder fish that will be delivered to Haiti in about 2 months. At the hatchery, the fish multiply rapidly into millions. Gambusia fish thrive in the worst conditions imaginable and eat many times their body weight in mosquito larvae/eggs. The Haitian Red Cross will partner with OBI to provide the volunteers needed to release the fish into stagnant, mosquito-infested waters around the country. In addition to the Gambusia, OBI will also import truck mounted insecticide sprayers, 11 backpack spray units, 10 tons of spraying material and 3,600 larvacide briquettes for the purposes of this mosquito abatement program.",,,,,,Health,Health,,Operation Blessing International,Haitian Red Cross,,,,Haiti,Ouest,Port-au-Prince,,,,,http://www.ob.org/haitiprojects/MosquitoFish.asp,9/22/2010

Teams will be conducting an impact study over a 6-month period in the villages that receive the jerrycans, comparing the prevalence of water-borne illness in families who use the systems and those who do not. It is hopeful that this new technology will result in the ability to provide safe, clean drinking water to people all over the world at a fraction of the cost of other methods.

Operation Blessing International,OBI-HT-10-022,Sustainable Fish Farms,"Operation Blessing has partnered with Caribbean Harvest, a Haitian charity, to help fund a remarkable fish-farming program that will provide food and sustainable incomes for nearly 100 families. Families receive a starter kit ($1,000 value) containing a floating metal cage, 2,400 baby fish and a four-month supply of fish food. Caribbean Harvests staff teaches the family how to raise the fish and then provides ongoing weekly oversight. In just four months, fish are fully grown and can be sold in markets. Profits earned from the sale of the fish give each family approximately $500 in addition to covering the cost of purchasing another 2,400 baby fish and four-month supply of fish food. The harvest cycle repeats almost 2.5 times a year, helping each family earn an annual income of around $1,200. This project will create over 4,000 new jobs over the next two years, with a ratio of one job per every ton of fish produced.
