    :body         => '<h3>Top ten things you should know about the data.</h3>

                      <p>To try to ensure that visitors to our site understand the data and are interpreting it correctly, we’ve put together this list of things you should know about the information on this site. If there is something else that needs clarification, drop us a line at mappinginfo@interaction.org.</p>

                      <h3>Participation is limited to InterAction members.</h3>
                      <p>This site only features information on the work of InterAction members. While we recognize that this is only a partial picture of the work being done to reduce poverty and respond to crises or disasters, much of this information would not be available otherwise. By focusing on our members, which manage billions of dollars in public and private funding every year, our goal is to add to the information currently available about aid activities around the world.</p>

                      <h3>The site only contains information we receive directly from organizations.</h3>
                      <p>All data is provided to InterAction on a voluntary basis by member organizations, which are set up with an NGO Aid Map Member Workspace account where they can add or update data directly. InterAction does not gather information independently. Organizations may choose to report on all of their projects, or only a portion. To help visitors understand what portion of its work an organization has provided information on, organizations can provide additional information through an “organization form” which is listed as a resource on the site’s organization pages. This form provides information on how many active projects an organization has at any given time, how frequently an organization will update its data, etc.</p>

                      <h3>Data is updated at least three times a year.</h3>
                      <p>Members can update their data at any time, but InterAction sends out official "data calls" three times a year. </p>

                      <h3>Data is reviewed, but not vetted.</h3> 
                      <p>InterAction relies on its members to provide accurate and complete information on their activities. Members of InterAction must abide by a set of comprehensive Private Voluntary Organization (PVO) standards governing financial management, fundraising, governance and program performance in order to remain part of InterAction. While we cannot independently verify the information submitted, InterAction does review the data to check for inconsistencies and follows up with organizations, as needed.</p> 

                      <h3>Only active projects are displayed on the map.</h3>
                      <p>As projects end, they are automatically removed from the site. If you would like information on past projects, please contact us.</p>

                      <h3>Only seven fields are required.</h3>
                      <p>For a project to appear on NGO Aid Map, organizations must provide information on the following seven fields:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Organization</li>
                        <li>Project Title</li>
                        <li>Project Description</li>
                        <li>Start Date</li>
                        <li>End Date</li>
                        <li>Sector</li>
                        <li>Country</li>
                      </ul>

                      <p>For more details about all the data fields, please see this short guidance document on providing project information and this guidance document on submitting information on in-kind donations.</p>

                      <h3>The bubbles on the map do not represent exact project locations.</h3>
                      <p>We encourage organizations to provide geographic information on their projects down to the state or province level (ADM1) whenever possible. When this information is provided, the bubble on the map corresponds to the center point of the state(s) in which that project takes place. If no sub-national geographic information is provided, the bubble corresponds to the center point of the country or countries in which that project takes place.</p>

                      <h3>One project can take place in multiple locations and be categorized under more than one sector.</h3>
                      <p>This means that you should not add up the number of projects across locations, or across sectors. For example, a project aimed at reducing chronic under-nutrition in children under five may involve working with health clinics to identify and treat malnourished children, as well as to improve access to clean water and sanitation in a community. This project would be coded under “health” as well as “water, sanitation and hygiene” and therefore would be included in the count for both sectors. If you added the number of projects by sector, you’d be counting this project twice: once under “health” and once under “water, sanitation and hygiene”.</p>

                      <h3>Different projects may target the same population.</h3>
                      <p>A given population may be the target of different projects by one or more organizations. For example, one organization may be working with a community to encourage clean hygiene, while another organization may be promoting the participation of women in that same community in public health activities. While some people in the community may only be involved in one project, some may be involved in both. Adding up the number of people reached for both projects would cause you to count some people twice. You should also keep in mind that organizations calculate the “number of people reached” differently.</p>

                      <h3>Both “prime” and sub-awardees may report on a project.</h3>
                      <p>Because we encourage all of our members to submit data to the site, this means that sometimes two or more organizations end up reporting on the same project: the prime awardee, which received funding directly from a donor, and one or more sub-awardees, who receive funding from the prime awardee to implement the project. These duplicates account for a small portion of the projects on the site, but to minimize overlaps we ask organizations to only report on the portion of the project they are responsible for implementing. We also ask organizations to identify the prime awardee of a project, so that it is possible to trace the flow of funding. For this reason, you should take care when adding up project budgets across organizations.</p>

                      <p>Five principles underpin everything we do.</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li><p>Make it as easy as possible to share data. If it’s not easy, organizations won’t keep providing information, and there’s little value to a map that never gets updated.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Present the data in a way that makes it simple to understand and use. Our site is designed to make it easy to find the information people are looking for, to help them make the decisions they need to make.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Make the data open and accessible. We know there are many ways to slice and dice data. That’s why we’ve made it possible to download the data on every page of the site.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Do no harm. While we are strong advocates of openness, we realize there can be negative consequences to sharing data. We let organizations know that they should only share information if it is safe to do so, and review data that has been submitted to make sure that there isn't anything that could put someone in harm's way.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Collaborate with like-minded organizations also working to make more information available. NGO Aid Map is just one piece of the puzzle. By working with organizations who also see the value in open data, we hope to create a more complete picture of what is happening with international aid.</p></li>

                        <p>By making information on NGO activities easily accessible, NGO Aid Map strives to:</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Promote transparency.</li>
                          <li>Facilitate partnerships and improve coordination.</li>
                          <li>Publicize the work of NGOs.</li>
                          <li>Help guide decisions about where to direct aid resources.</li>
                          <li>Inform advocacy and influence policy.</li>
                        </ul>
                      </div>

                      <h3>Who can participate? Which organizations are represented on this site?</h3>
                      <div>
                        <p>Only InterAction member organizations can participate and contribute data to NGO Aid Map at this time, and their participation is completely voluntary. NGO Aid Map features information on InterAction members working either directly on the ground, or indirectly through local or international partners.</p>
                      </div>

                      <h3>What data is available?</h3>
                      <div>
                        <p>On the home page, you will find a world map with all active projects that have been added by InterAction members. You can filter this information by donor, location, sector, or implementing organization. Additionally, you view the map with additional layers of additional data sets, such as poverty rates, to help provide further context. Read more about the data here.</p>
                      </div>

                      <h3>Why do some countries have very few projects?</h3>
                      <div>
                        <p>Data is provided by our members on a voluntary basis, so the map is a partial picture of what our community does. Projects are continuously being added, so we encourage you to visit often to learn more about the work of InterAction members.</p>
                      </div>

                      <h3>How often is the information updated?</h3>
                      <div>
                        <p>InterAction members can log in to NGO Aid Map at any time to add or update data. Our team facilitates three data calls a year to help ensure organizations keep their data up to date.</p>
                      </div>

                      <h3>Is the data on the site vetted?</h3>
                      <div>
                        <p>No. InterAction relies on its members and other participating organizations to provide accurate and complete information on their work. We review the data to check for inconsistencies, code the data by sector, and follow up with organizations as needed to ensure that their information is as complete as possible. However, InterAction cannot independently verify the accuracy of the information submitted.</p>
                      </div>

                      <h3>How can organizations participate in the NGO Aid Map?</h3>
                      <div>
                        <p>Only InterAction members can participate in NGO Aid Map at this time (find out how to apply to become an InterAction member).

                      <h3>What data do InterAction members have to share to submit a project to NGO Aid Map?</h3>
                      <div>
                        <p>We encourage members to add as much project data as possible, including budget, pictures and videos, and contact information. For a project to become active on NGO Aid Map, the InterAction member organization must share the following minimum amount of information:</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Organization name.</li>
                          <li>Project description.</li>
                          <li>Start date.</li>
                          <li>End date.</li>
                          <li>Sector(s).</li>
                          <li>Country.</li>
                        </ul>
                      </div>
