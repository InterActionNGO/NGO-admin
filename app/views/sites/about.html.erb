          <h1>About NGO Aid Maps</h1>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="body">
        <p>As part of its efforts to demonstrate the global reach of NGOs and enhance the community’s accountability and impact, InterAction has developed this site to map our membersÅf work. By working closely with our members, InterAction seeks to ensure that NGO Aid Map is an effective, flexible and sustainable tool for capturing project information across all countries and sectors. Best practices in select areas will also be featured.</p>
        <p>The goals of NGO Aid Map are to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Increase transparency within the NGO community</li>
          <li>Facilitate partnerships and improve coordination among NGOs, private sector, governments and donors</li>
          <li>Help NGOs and others involved in relief and development make more informed decisions about where to direct their resources</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>FOCUS AREAS</h3>
        <p>Our mapping work is currently focused on two areas:</p>
        <p><a href="http://food.ngoaidmap.org">Food Security</a>: With funding from the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), InterAction has begun mapping members’ food security work around the world, with an initial focus on these countries: Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guatemala, Haiti, Liberia, Mali, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal and Tanzania. Members may also choose to provide information on their work in additional countries. The Food Security Aid Map will be completed by March 2011.</p>
        <p><a href="http://food.ngoaidmap.org">Haiti</a>: Since the earthquake in January 2010, InterAction, in partnership with BCLC and with funding from FedEx, has developed a web-based mapping platform to highlight NGOs programs in Haiti.  InterAction has been working closely with its members to develop a data collection system that is flexible and can be deployed in future emergencies.</p>
        <br/>
